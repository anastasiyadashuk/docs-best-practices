## Things to Avoid in Documentation

- **Jargon Overload:** Avoid using excessive technical jargon or industry-specific terms without providing clear explanations. Use language that's easily understood by the intended audience.

- **Marketing Language:** Steer clear of promotional or overly persuasive language. Documentation should inform and guide, not sell the product.

- **Assumptions about User Knowledge:** Don't assume users have the same level of expertise as the document creators. Provide comprehensive explanations, even for seemingly basic concepts.

- **Incomplete or Outdated Information:** Ensure the documentation is up to date and comprehensive. Incomplete or obsolete information can mislead users and cause frustration.

- **Unclear Structure and Formatting:** Maintain a clear, consistent structure throughout the documentation. Unclear organization or inconsistent formatting can make it challenging for users to find information.

- **Lack of Visual Aids:** Avoid excessive text without visual support. Utilize images, diagrams, and examples to enhance understanding.

- **No Actionable Guidance:** Ensure that the documentation offers clear, step-by-step guidance for users to achieve their goals. Vague instructions or unclear steps can be frustrating.

- **Overlooking User Feedback:** Don't disregard user feedback. Incorporate user suggestions and issues into documentation improvements.

- **Neglecting Searchability:** Ensure the documentation is easily searchable. Use clear headers, keywords, and a comprehensive index for quick navigation.

- **Overuse of Passive Voice:** Minimize the use of passive voice as it can make instructions less direct and engaging.

- **Overly Lengthy Content**: Avoid unnecessarily long paragraphs or explanations. Aim for concise and clear content to keep users engaged and focused.

## Best Practices for Documentation

- **Use Active Voice:** Frame sentences in the active voice to make instructions more direct and engaging. For instance, instead of saying "The action was performed by the system," use "The system performed the action."

- **Concise Language:** Keep sentences and paragraphs concise. Avoid unnecessary words or overly elaborate explanations. Best practice: no more than 3 sentences per paragraph.

- **Consistent Terminology:** Maintain consistent terminology throughout the documentation. Use the same words for the same concepts to avoid confusion.

- **Descriptive Headings and Subheadings:** Create informative and clear headings and subheadings that accurately represent the content that follows.

- **Use Bulleted or Numbered Lists:** Break down information into lists for easier comprehension. Use bullets for unordered information and numbers for ordered steps.

- **Plain Language Approach:** Write in a manner that's accessible to users with varying levels of expertise. Explain technical terms and acronyms when they are used.

- **Practical Examples:** Incorporate practical examples and use cases to illustrate how to apply the information in real-world scenarios.

- **Consistent Tone and Style:** Maintain a consistent tone and style throughout the documentation. Align it with the brand's voice and the user's expectations.

- **Frontload Information:** Put the most critical information at the beginning of sections or sentences to grab the reader's attention and communicate the key points upfront.

- **Use Cross-References:** Link related sections or documents to facilitate further understanding and context.

- **Empathetic and Solution-Oriented:** Frame the documentation with a focus on solving user problems. Acknowledge the user's challenges and offer solutions.

- **Provide Context and Why Statements:** Explain the context and rationale behind instructions. Users should understand why certain actions are necessary.
